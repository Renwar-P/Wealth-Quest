#### HELLO EVERYONE!

This is the documentation for our website: A financial game inspired the original boardgame [Cashflow](https://www.richdad.com/products/cashflow-classic) designed by Robert Kawosaki! It has been built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript as a part of Code Institute's January 2024 hackathon. Disclaimer: This game is not only for entertainment purposes, and should by no means be used for real-world financial planning.

## Project Development and Planning 

### Project Goals 

#### Project Purpose

This game was planned and developed using principles of User Experience (UX) design, which include the five planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, and Surface. Using these principles, the aim was to create a fun, easy-to-use, responsive, and engaging game that entertains users who are interested in learning more about financial concepts. 

#### Client Goals

Our website was built as a part of the January 2024 Budget-Buster-themed hackathon with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/full-stack-software-development-diploma/). It is an interactive game designed to entertain users of all ages and backgrounds who want to learn more about financial planning, particularly those interested in investing, passive income and budgeting. Despite this being built for a hackathon, it was still treated as a real-world application for potential clients interested in learning about how to financially plan in a fun, engaging way. Thus, this client's goals would be:

- Engaging the users with interactive, fun prompts, such as life happenings, deals and expenses
- Helping users learn more about how to spend or save their money
- Entertaining users by giving them different financial scenarios and choices of how to manage them
- Ensuring the questions and options are clear, and the game is simple to navigate

#### Target Audience

- This game is designed for users of any background or age, but will most likely gain more interest from those interested in budgeting, saving and investing
- It is also likely to draw in users who want to play around with different incomes and learn how to generate passive income 
- The simplicity of the game makes it easy for adults, teenagers and even children to take, and retake, the game as many times as they want, until they win

### Research 

#### Key Takeaways

We reviewed other websites and games to get an idea of how we should implement our design and functionality. These are our key takeaways:

- The website should be eye-catching, to make users excited about playing the game
- The Website should be clean, simple, and easy to navigate
- The game should be fun and easy to navigate through
- The game should be challenging but not too difficult 
- The user should feel as if they are winning, but not too easily

### User Stories

As a first-time user, I would like to:

- take part in a fun, interesting game and learn more about financial planning
- find out what the game is about and what to expect before starting
- navigate easily through the game
- be able to view my financial statement at any time in the game
- be able to make choices in the game and see immediate results on my financial statement
- access the game on any device

These user stories gave us a clear scope for the game and enabled us to stay on track with the project, preventing issues like scope creep at a later stage after the coding process. 

### Design, Layout and Structure 

#### Wireframes

We used [Figma](https://figma.com/) in the initial design phase, before the coding process. This enabled us to develop the game's structure, skeleton, layout and overall look and style. We created designs for desktop, tablet and mobile screens to ensure that responsiveness was at the forefront of the application from the beginning.

#### Design and Colour

This site was designed using a mobile-first approach, because after conducting some research (using sites like [Adobe](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/what-is-mobile-first-design/)), it appears that most users use their mobile devices over desktop or iPad screens, especially when partaking in quizzes. 

- The design includes eye-catching colours of purples and yellows, and a spinning wheel to create a boardgame feel
- A different colour palette was used for the progress bar to differentiate it from the rest of the game elements
- The game is setup on one screen with numerous modals being shown and hidden as the game progresses
- The colours applied to the buttons, headings and font are all consistent throughout

#### Font

Our choice of font was [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto). The light font was used for all paragraphs and and the bold font was used for all headings and buttons. This font choice was imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and had a backup font of Serif. We chose this font for my website because the style contributed to the financial game theme, whilst also providing a professional, legible finish.

## Technologies Used 

This website used a combination of three different Front-End development languages, as well as some web tools for the initial planning. A list of those included in the project can be seen as follows: 

### Languages 
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- [Bootstrap Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap)
- [Vue Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue)

### Tools 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control via GitPod, by using the terminal to Git and Push to GitHub.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub was used to store the project code after being created in GitPod/Git.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    - Gitpod was used to create, edit and preview the project's code.
- [Figma](https://figma.com/)
     - Figma was used to create wireframes during the initial design process.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google Fonts was used to select and import the fonts to the project (Libre Baskerville and Libre Baskerville Bold).
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Font Awesome was used to add icons to the site to help with UX and to add more character to the project visually.
- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html) and [Adobe Color] (https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
    - These were used to create the colour pallette as well as ideas for the initial design.
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)
    - Used to create and add the favicon to the browser tab.

## Testing

Due to the limited time frame of this hackathon (5 days), we decided to focus mainly on manual testing. If we had a longer time frame, we would have also undergone automated testing.

### Manual Testing

#### Testing User Stories

#### Browser Compatibility

The site was tested on the following browsers, with no browser-specific bugs detected. 

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari

#### Responsiveness/Device Testing

The game was tested on the following devices:
- HP Display 27-inch External Monitor
- Apple Macbook Pro 13-inch
- Galaxy S9+
- Apple iPhone 12 Pro
- Apple iPhone SE
- Apple iPad mini
- Apple iPad
- Galaxy Tablet
- Google Chrome Developer Tools - using responsive testing for all screen sizes

The game functioned as expected on all devices.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
2. From the left hand menu select 'Pages'.
3. From the source select Branch: main.
4. Click 'Save'.
5. A live link will be displayed when published successfully.
